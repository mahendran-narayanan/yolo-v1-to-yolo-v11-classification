# Yolo v1 to Yolo v11 model architectures

This repository contains yolo models used for classification purposes only.
Proposed model architecture is available. Ready to train on any classification datesets.

Currently available model architectures are listed below. More models to be added soon.

# Yolo v1

Yolov1 model proposed in the paper titled "You Only Look Once: Unified, Real-Time Object Detection" architecture is in [here](https://github.com/mahendran-narayanan/yolo-v1-to-yolo-v11-classification/blob/main/models/yolo%20v1/yolov1.py)
